## Welcome to the CMS Data Analysis School 2024 JPsi-JPsi Long exercise

This exercise looks for possible tetraquark candidates that decays into double J/ψ, and each J/ψ decays in dimouns. **Our exercises will all use real data!** 

This analysis will search for structures near the J/psiJ/psi mass threshold using CMS Run II data at sqrt(s)=13 TeV. <!-- Based on the hints of possible structures found in CMS Run I data, a mass region between 6.26 GeV and 7.8 GeV is blinded in Run II data to prevent analysis bias. We will learn how to decide the fit strategy before unblinding the data,--> We will learn the procedure to distinguish multiple new structures from background. A simple method to determine the significance of new structure will be applied in the process.

The overall purpose of this exercise is to provide you with a basic understanding of a physical analysis and the opportunity to participate in it. Considering that we need to compress an analysis that has taken several years into a few days of exercise, we need to capture as many of the key aspects as possible. We will provide you with examples of some of the procedures to help you understand them. And for some of the procedures that are time-consuming because of large data, you will only need to be able to run through them with a small amount of data, and we will provide you with pre-prepared data for the next step. If you have any questions about the exercise, please feel free to ask. If you have better insights or ways to any part, please feel free to do that as well. It is sincere hope that we all get a lot out of this exercise!
 
> ## Exercise Goals
> - Reconstruct double Jψ events from raw data
> - Estimate background from data itself
